		<h1>Miss Baker's Historic Flight</h1>
		
		<p>Miss Baker and fellow female pioneer Able's historic flight on <time datetime="1959-05-28">May 28, 1959</time> proved a turning point in the US space era. The first beings ever to be recovered alive from a flight into outer space, their journey paved the way for putting the first man into orbit around the earth.</p>

			<figcaption>Miss Baker, the original space pioneer, contemplates her first flight heavenward.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Miss Baker's journey lasted 15 minutes and reached speeds of up to 10,000 MPH. Baker and Able were weightless for nine minutes. A <abbr>NASA</abbr> spokesperson stated that the monkeys were in "perfect condition" on their return to earth. Indeed Miss Baker went on to live a long and fruitful life, living until 1984.</p>
		
	
	<aside><!-- comment --></aside>		
		
		<p>Miss Baker and Able's journey gripped the world's imagination. Appearing on the June 15, 1959 cover of <a href="http://lifemagazine.pdf">Life magazine</a> the pair joined a growing list of women celebrities to grace the magazine's cover in 1959, a list which included <a href="http://twitter.com/marilynmonroe" rel="met sweetheart friend">Marilyn Monroe</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/zsazsa">Zsa Zsa Gabor</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com">Jackie Kennedy</a>.</p>

	<section id="mission">
		<h1>The Mission</h1>
		
		<p>Miss Baker's flight aboard the was another milestone in the history of space flight, proving that life could be sustained in space. During the period of weightlessness along the flight's trajectory arc, the physiological responses of Baker approached normal. According to telemetry data, Baker even appeared to doze or become drowsy. Upon reentry, however, the responses of both monkeys rose again, with the animals nearing a settled physiological state at landing.</p>
		
		<p>The <b>Jupiter AM-18 IRBM</b> (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the US Army as a long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed by the USAF for political reasons. It was also the only one of the United States' early stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.</p>

		<h1>The US Space Programme</h1>

		<p>This is general info. on the US space programme and is tangential to the main content of the page which is about Miss Baker. I'll add more to this shortly, but wanted to get the general thrust right of the whole page right first.</p>
		
		<!-- In our workshops, we've used <aside> to add semantic meaning to content that is a part of the main body (main column), but that is tangentially related as per the Switzerland example - http://j.mp/whatwgaside - in the WHATWG's documentation. I wasn't thinking of using a sidebar for this, but open to suggestion. -->
