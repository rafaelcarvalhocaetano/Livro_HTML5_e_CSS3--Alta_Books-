Please note that the example content actually relates to a space monkey named Miss Baker, rather than Gordo as quoted in the book.

Use the miss-baker.txt file to create a sample page marked up in your preferred flavour of HTML ready for conversion to HTML5 in the next chapter. There is also an accompanying image to go with the content.

Note that the content related to the US Space Programme is only loosely related to the main body content of the page.
